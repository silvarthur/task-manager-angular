# Mean Task Manager

## Objective
The objective behind implementing this application is to improve my abilities as a web developer. Basically, to gain experience with the MEAN Stack, which is Mongo DB, Express.js, Angular JS, and Node.js.

## What can this task manager do?
Using this application, the user can add a task to a list of open task. After finishing it, the user can mark the task as done and move it to a list of finished tasks. The task can be edited if it is in the list of open tasks. When the task is moved ot the list of finished tasks, it can be removed from the system.
